      <description>As developers, we often have to interface with third-party APIs. This is no different when writing Elixir apps. Rather than pulling in some third-party library that&amp;rsquo;s specific to the API, I prefer to use HTTPoison to give me the minimal amount of functionality to write my own wrapper.

      <description>I have been in software development for over a decade working on a variety of solutions, starting with a Windows desktop application and eventually transitioning onto the web. I have worked with a variety of businesses ranging from startups all the way to big brands. Software I have worked on includes anything from small internal applications to large e-commerce solutions to large data transformation (ETL) pipelines. I have built production systems in a variety of languages and frameworks including Ruby / Rails, Python, and, more recently, Elixir and Erlang.</description>
