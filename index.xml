          In this Let&amp;rsquo;s Code series, I will be walking through how I added a simple contact form to a Phoenix 1.4 web application. I will try to make this as general purpose as possible so that it&amp;rsquo;s easier to follow and apply to your own Phoenix applications. I encourage you to follow along, either in an existing Phoenix application or a new one.
In Part One of this series, I started with a Message module to serve as the data object for the contact form.

The contact form will take the minimal number of fields from the user (email, subject, and body) and send that information to a support email address.

      <title>Publishing a Hugo Site to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions</title>

          As of this writing, I am currently using the Hugo static site generator for this site and publishing to GitHub pages. The code is open-source on GitHub. To organize the code, I like to keep the Hugo source files in the master branch and publish from the gh-pages branch. To publish the site, I use a script that I can run locally, but I wanted to check out the relatively new GitHub Actions to see if I could automate the process after a push to the master branch.

      <title>Writing an API Wrapper in Elixir With HTTPoison</title>

          As developers, we often have to interface with third-party APIs. This is no different when writing Elixir apps. Rather than pulling in some third-party library that&amp;rsquo;s specific to the API, I prefer to use HTTPoison to give me the minimal amount of functionality to write my own wrapper. I prefer to own the API implementation for a few reasons:
 Only the paths that are used are brought in, alleviating excess code from API implementation that isn&amp;rsquo;t used.

          I have been in software development for over a decade working on a variety of solutions, starting with a Windows desktop application and eventually transitioning onto the web. I have worked with a variety of businesses ranging from startups all the way to big brands. Software I have worked on includes anything from small internal applications to large e-commerce solutions to large data transformation (ETL) pipelines. I have built production systems in a variety of languages and frameworks including Ruby / Rails, Python, and, more recently, Elixir and Erlang.
