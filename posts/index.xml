      <description>Background As of this writing, I am currently using the Hugo static site generator for this site and publishing to GitHub pages. The code is open-source on GitHub. To organize the code, I like to keep the Hugo source files in the master branch and publish from the gh-pages branch. To publish the site, I use a script that I can run locally, but I wanted to check out the relatively new GitHub Actions to see if I could automate the process after a push to the master branch.</description>

      <description>As developers, we often have to interface with third-party APIs. This is no different when writing Elixir apps. Rather than pulling in some third-party library that&amp;rsquo;s specific to the API, I prefer to use HTTPoison to give me the minimal amount of functionality to write my own wrapper. I prefer to own the API implementation for a few reasons:
 Only the paths that are used are brought in, alleviating excess code from API implementation that isn&amp;rsquo;t used.</description>
