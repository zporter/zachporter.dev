          In this Let&amp;rsquo;s Code series, I will be walking through how I added a simple contact form to a Phoenix 1.4 web application. I will try to make this as general purpose as possible so that it&amp;rsquo;s easier to follow and apply to your Phoenix applications. I encourage you to follow along, either in an existing Phoenix application or a new one.
The contact form will take the minimal number of fields from the user (email, subject, and body) and send that information to a support email address.

      <title>Writing an API Wrapper in Elixir With HTTPoison</title>

          As developers, we often have to interface with third-party APIs. This is no different when writing Elixir apps. Rather than pulling in some third-party library that&amp;rsquo;s specific to the API, I prefer to use HTTPoison to give me the minimal amount of functionality to write my own wrapper. I prefer to own the API implementation for a few reasons:
 Only the paths that are used are brought in, alleviating excess code from API implementation that isn&amp;rsquo;t used.
