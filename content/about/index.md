I have been in software development for over a decade working on a variety of solutions, starting with a Windows desktop application and eventually transitioning onto the web. I have worked with a variety of businesses ranging from startups all the way to big brands. Software I have worked on includes anything from small internal applications to large e-commerce solutions to large data transformation [(ETL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) pipelines. I have built production systems in a variety of languages and frameworks including Ruby / Rails, Python, and, more recently, Elixir and Erlang. A bulk of my experience comes from working with large object-oriented codebases, but my current passion lies in functional programming. I enjoy building software that makes others' lives easier, so they have a positive technological experience.

When I am not writing code, I'm spending time with my wife and four kids in Durham, NC. We enjoy hiking and spending time outdoors as much as we can; board games and reading for the times that we cannot.

## Speaking Engagements

I have enjoyed talking and sharing at the local [Elixir Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Triangle-Elixir/). If you are in the area, stop by some time and say hi!

I also spoke at ElixirConf 2018 on [_Breaking Down the User Monolith_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7tFvmFDbZE). This subject was a passion project of mine as I came to better understand [_Domain-Driven Design_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) and really appreciate the design of Elixir's [Ecto](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.html) library.

You can discuss this talk more over on [the Elixir Forum](https://elixirforum.com/t/40-elixirconf-us-2018-breaking-down-the-user-monolith-zach-porter/16709).
