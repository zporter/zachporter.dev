      <p>I have been in software development for over a decade working on a variety of solutions, starting with a Windows desktop application and eventually transitioning onto the web. I have worked with a variety of businesses ranging from startups all the way to big brands. Software I have worked on includes anything from small internal applications to large e-commerce solutions to large data transformation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">(ETL)</a> pipelines. I have built production systems in a variety of languages and frameworks including Ruby / Rails, Python, and, more recently, Elixir and Erlang. A bulk of my experience comes from working with large object-oriented codebases, but my current passion lies in functional programming. I enjoy building software that makes others&rsquo; lives easier, so they have a positive experience with tech.</p>
<p>When I am not writing code, I&rsquo;m spending time with my wife and four kids in Durham, NC. We enjoy hiking and spending time outdoors as much as we can; board games and reading for the times that we cannot.</p>
<h2 id="speaking-engagements">Speaking Engagements</h2>
<p>I have enjoyed talking and sharing at the local <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Triangle-Elixir/">Elixir Meetup</a>. If you are in the area, stop by some time and say hi!</p>
<p>I also spoke at ElixirConf 2018 on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7tFvmFDbZE"><em>Breaking Down the User Monolith</em></a>. This subject was a passion project of mine as I came to better understand <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design"><em>Domain-Driven Design</em></a> and really appreciate the design of Elixir&rsquo;s <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.html">Ecto</a> library.</p>

<p>You can discuss this talk more over on <a href="https://elixirforum.com/t/40-elixirconf-us-2018-breaking-down-the-user-monolith-zach-porter/16709">the Elixir Forum</a>.</p>
